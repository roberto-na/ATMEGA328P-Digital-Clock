# ATMEGA328P-Digital-Clock
This is a repository that contains the framework for a digital clock for devices with less than 32kb of flash memory such as the ATMEGA328P microcontroller.

By connecting the microcontroller to a 7 segment clock display and adding a buzzer the following code written in C allows to set a digital clock with an integrated alarm.

# Setup
Load the code to the microcontroller using a ATAVRISP2-ND and [AVRDUDE](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)

# Next steps
Update the library with the Assembly code to improve performance
